# Advanced_EDA
Advanced_EDA class is a useful collection of basic and advanced EDA methods.
It includes methods to create and use ProfileReport which was written by Simon Brugman (https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling).
ProfileReport is a very beautiful report for pandas dataframe and useful for analyzing the entire small/medium dataset properties, and it can take some time to run it.
So when I need to analyze just specific features, I prefer to use other methods of my Advanced_EDA class.

Dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime

I've uploaded two versions with identical code for Jupiter and PyCharm usage:
  * For Jupyter open "main_Jup - example to use Advanced_EDA.ipynb"
  * For PyCharm open "main - example to use Advanced_EDA.py"
