# Advanced_EDA
Advanced_EDA class is a useful collection of basic and advanced EDA methods.

It also includes methods to create and use ProfileReport which was written by Simon Brugman (https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling).
ProfileReport is fantastic pandas dataframe report and very useful for analyzing the entire small/medium dataset properties. 
But when I need to analyze just specific features, I prefer to use my Advanced_EDA class.

**Add EXAMPLES to some methods
