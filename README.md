# Advanced_EDA
Advanced_EDA class is a useful collection of basic and advanced EDA methods.

It also includes methods to create and use ProfileReport which was written by Simon Brugman ( see  https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling).
ProfileReport is fantastic pandas dataframe report and very useful for analyzing of the entire small/medium dataset properties. 

But when I need to analyze just specific features, I prefer to use my Advanced_EDA class.

**Add EXAMPLES to some methods

Download 'Advanced_EDA_ISK.ipynb' and import it to your jupyter-notebook as follow:
import import_ipynb      # to import jupyter-notebook A into notebook B
import Advanced_EDA_ISK  # to import Advanced_EDA_ISK.ipynb
